      <h2>Best Cities for Real Estate Investors</h2>
      <p>
        As 2025 unfolds, real estate investors are looking at new hotspots with high growth potential. 
        Metropolitan hubs like Karachi and Lahore remain strong due to rising demand for urban housing. 
        Islamabad continues to attract investors because of government-backed development projects and 
        improved infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emerging suburban areas are also gaining popularity thanks to affordable pricing and proximity 
        to major cities. Gwadar is expected to be a major game-changer, driven by CPEC and port-related 
        developments. Overseas investors are showing increased interest in Pakistan’s real estate sector, 
        which signals strong confidence for the coming years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lahore — A cornerstone of investment appeal, driven by rapid urban development and booming infrastructure.
         Residential areas like DHA Lahore, Bahria Town, Gulberg, and Johar Town continue to attract investors
          due to solid rental yields of 6%–9% annually and strong capital appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>Karachi — Pakistan’s financial heartbeat, offering diverse real estate opportunities across commercial
         and residential sectors. Notable areas include DHA, Clifton, Bahria Town Karachi, plus emerging zones
          like Korangi Road and Gadap Town, where investors can expect 25%–45% appreciation in developing pockets</p>
          <p>Islamabad / Rawalpindi — The twin cities offer stability, strategic infrastructure, and consistent growth.
             Prime sectors include DHA Islamabad, Bahria Town, Gulberg Greens, Rudn Enclave, and Nova City. Appreciation 
             ranges from 15%–20% annually, supported by projects like the Islamabad Ring Road and Blue Area commercial expansion.</p>
             <p>
                Multan — Fast emerging as a key investment hub thanks to excellent connectivity via the M-5 Motorway, 
                Multan Metro, and airport expansions. Top areas include DHA Multan, Wapda Town, Citi Housing, and Model 
                Town—some blocks have seen ~30% price increase since 2022, with rental yields around 7.5% in prime areas 
                like Bosan Road.
             </p>
             <p>
                Gwadar — Positioned as a strategic future-centric zone, driven by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), 
                free trade zones, and ongoing infrastructure developments. While more speculative, experts forecast 10%–15% annual
                 appreciation, making Gwadar a powerful long-term bet for visionary investors.
