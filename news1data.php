      <h2>Property Market Growth in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        The real estate sector in 2025 has shown significant growth, 
        driven by increased demand for both residential and commercial properties. 
        Urban development projects, new investment policies, and foreign investments 
        are reshaping the housing market.

      <p>
        According to recent surveys, mid-sized cities are becoming the new hotspots 
        for real estate investment. Renovations, smart homes, and eco-friendly housing 
        are gaining popularity among buyers. 
        Experts suggest that this trend will continue, offering both challenges 
        and opportunities for buyers, sellers, and investors.

        The property market in 2025 is experiencing steady growth, supported by improved economic conditions,
         reduced inflation, and lower interest rates that have made borrowing more accessible for buyers and 
         developers.Real estate prices are projected to rise by 8–10% this year, with high-demand areas like 
         DHA Karachi, DHA Lahore,and Bahria Town seeing appreciation as high as 15–20%. Urbanization continues
         to fuel demand, with around 36% of the population now living in cities, driving the need for housing
         and infrastructure. Suburban and emerging localities such as Gwadar and Gulberg Islamabad are 
         witnessing rapid value increases due to major projects like CPEC, Ring Road expansions, 
         and Special Economic Zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affordable housing remains a strong growth driver, backed by government schemes like the Naya Pakistan 
        Housing Program, while luxury apartments and gated communities continue to attract investors due to their
        security and amenities. Technology is reshaping the market with PropTech innovations such as virtual tours,
        online listings, and blockchain-based transactions, making property buying more transparent and efficient.
        Additionally, sustainable housing is gaining importance as buyers demand energy-efficient buildings and 
        eco-friendly materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outdoor and smart home features are also influencing purchasing decisions, as modern buyers prioritize
         functionality along with style. Globally, the real estate sector is also expanding, with market value 
         expected to climb from $4.12 trillion in 2024 to $4.34 trillion in 2025, while Dubai and Spain have 
         emerged as international hotspots, attracting foreign investors. In Pakistan, overseas interest is 
         strengthening, showing confidence in long-term stability and profitability. Overall, a combination
          of economic reforms, urban migration, infrastructure projects, and digital transformation is shaping 
          the property market into one of the most promising investment avenues of 2025
